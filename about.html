<h2>WHO I AM</h2>
<p>Throughout my life, I have been very enthusiastic about having a positive impact on the lives of others, and hope to continue that passion through my career as a UX professional. I love working with people and am fascinated by how they work, which is ultimately what drew me to my undergraduate degree in psychology. I also have always been quite analytical, constantly asking questions to fully understand a situation before going forward with responding to it. I am very meticulous as well, checking every detail of anything I do – from a project I’m working on to an event I’m planning – to ensure that everything is the way it is supposed to be and that nothing has been overlooked. These traits, combined with my love of psychology and helping others, drew me towards UX. UX is a field that requires lots of questions to be asked, details to be fleshed out, analytical thinking, and deliverables that will have an impact on people’s lives. I am very excited to see where this field will take me!</p>

<p>When I’m not volunteering, working, or doing schoolwork, you can probably find me cooking, working out, or hanging out with my friends.</p>

<h2>MY BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>Growing up in a family of Michigan fans, it was almost inevitable that I would pursue an undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan. I graduated in April 2018 with a B.S. in Psychology and minors in Judaic Studies and Science, Technology & Society. During my time as an undergraduate, I was heavily involved in community service through the University of Michigan chapter of Circle K International, becoming Club President my senior year. I also was an active member of Kappa Theta Pi, the world’s first co-ed professional technology fraternity, which allowed me to further enhance my professional and technical skills. As a junior and senior, I worked for Advanced Research Computing as a computing intern in the Technology Services department. In my second semester of senior year, I also began working as a research assistant for Dr. Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck, a role that I am continuing with as a graduate student.</p>
